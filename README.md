Description -
HTML -
1. HTML Structure:
The code starts by defining the basic structure of an HTML webpage, including the document type and language.
It then includes a <head> section where metadata and external resources like fonts and stylesheets are linked.
The <body> section contains the actual content of the webpage.
2. Header Section:
The main content begins with a heading section that introduces the new curriculum.
It includes a title, an image of the freeCodeCamp logo, a large title ("OUR NEW CURRICULUM"), and a subtitle explaining the curriculum change.
3. Author and Social Icons:
Below the heading, there's a section with the author's name, publication date, and social media icons for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube.
4. Text Section:
The main content is divided into different sections. The first text section contains paragraphs describing the change in the curriculum.
It mentions that the curriculum is shifting towards project-based learning rather than just coding challenges.
5. Quote and Flow:
A quote is highlighted using a blockquote. The quote emphasizes the idea of making the entire curriculum a series of projects.
The text explains that the new approach focuses on learning while building projects, with each project containing step-by-step tests.
6. Project Evolution:
Another text section provides a brief history of the freeCodeCamp curriculum, highlighting its evolution over different versions.
It mentions when various features and certifications were added to the curriculum.
7. Image Section:
Alongside the history text, there are images showcasing different projects from the curriculum.
Each image corresponds to a different project milestone in the curriculum's history.
Conclusion:
Overall, this HTML code creates a webpage that informs users about the transition from coding challenges to project-based learning in the freeCodeCamp curriculum.


CSS -
This piece of code is a set of instructions written in a language called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is used to style and format the appearance of a website or web page. Let's break it down into simpler terms:

The first part (*, ::before, ::after) is like a general rule that says any element (like a picture, a paragraph, a heading, etc.), as well as any content before or after an element, should have certain properties.

The html section sets the base font size for the whole page to be 62.5% of the default size. This makes it easier to work with font sizes later on.

The body section styles the background color of the entire webpage to a dark blue tone and sets the font to be a style called "Baskervville", which is a fancy font.

Different levels of headings (h1 to h6) are styled using different fonts, making them stand out from the rest of the text.

Links (a tags) are styled so that they don't have the default underline and their text color is changed to a light color.

The main section uses a grid layout to arrange its content. This layout divides the main content area into three columns: a narrow one on the left, a larger central one, and another narrow one on the right. The rows are spaced apart by 3rem.

Images are set to take up the entire width of their container, and they're adjusted to fit without stretching or squishing.

Horizontal lines (hr) are given a bit of space above and below them, and they're styled with a light gray color.

The heading class arranges its content in a two-column grid layout with some space between the rows.

The text class styles paragraphs with a slightly larger font size, some letter spacing, and a specific column width. The text is justified, meaning it's aligned on both the left and right sides.

The hero section takes up the entire width of its container and positions its content.

The hero-title and hero-subtitle classes style the main title and subtitle in the hero section, giving them large sizes and a reddish-orange color.

The author class styles the author's name, and the publish-date class gives a faded white color to the publication date.

Social icons are arranged in a grid layout, and their size is set to be 3rem.

The first letter of the first paragraph is enlarged and colored in reddish-orange.

Quotes are styled with a bluish color and centered. They also have quotation marks added before and after them.

Sections with images are set up in a grid layout with two columns and a bit of space between them.

Lists have no bullet points, and there's some space between list items.

Titles and subtitles in lists are given a bluish color.

Images are placed in a grid layout, with different arrangements on small screens.

Media queries are used to apply different styles for different screen sizes. For example, when the screen width is less than 720px, images are displayed in a single column instead of two.

Further adjustments are made for even smaller screens, like reducing font sizes and adjusting the layout to fit better on mobile devices.

In simpler terms, this code tells a web browser how to make a webpage look a certain way using various design choices like colors, fonts, spacing, and arrangement of elements, and it adapts the design for different screen sizes like desktops, tablets, and phones.
